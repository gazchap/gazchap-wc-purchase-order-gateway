Adds a Purchase Order payment gateway to WooCommerce.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a new offline payment gateway to WooCommerce that allows your customers to request an invoice with a Purchase Order.

There are a number of options:

- You can set the plugin to ask the customer for a Purchase Order Number, and dictate whether this is mandatory or can be left blank.

- You can set the plugin to ask the customer for a postal address for the invoice.

- You can set the plugin to pre-fill this address with the customer\'s existing billing address (if they are logged in, and have one set in WooCommerce)

- You can set the plugin to add supplied Purchase Order information to order notification emails

When an order is received, the plugin will add all of the submitted information on to the WooCommerce View Order screen.

Note: This plugin does not (currently, at least) generate the actual invoices - it is only used to collect the Purchase Order information.
